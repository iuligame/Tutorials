            <p class="text"><b>Minecraft</b> is an indepedent type of game sandbox write in Java, initied developed of
                Markus Alexej Perssen(Notch) and the last time of the Mojang swdan company.
                Other in-game activities include exploration, gathering resources, crafting and building gear, and
                combat. The game features some modes including Survival, Creative, Adventure and Spectator. In the first
                mode, players have to get the resources by themselves, using the resources to progress progressively,
                while in the Creative mode, the players have the opportunity to use their creativity through unlimited
                resources. Minecraft is a survival game and has neither levels nor specific missions for players to
                complete, which gives players a lot of freedom. However, the game has a few advancements available.
                Depending on the player's desire, the single-player or multiplayer option can be chosen. The core
                gameplay revolves around building and placing blocks. The game world is essentially made up of cubic
                blocks arranged in a fixed grid pattern, which represent different materials such as sand, stone,
                various ores, water, tree trunks, etc. While players can move freely throughout the world, objects and
                items can only be placed at certain fixed points relative to the grid. Players can collect these
                material blocks and place them in other places, thus opening up the possibility of building various
                types of buildings.</p>
